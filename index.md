# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals (https://github.com/alesandrsokirka/linear_regr_seoul_bikes/blob/main/final_linear_regr_seoul_bikes.ipynb)

<img src="https://github.com/alesandrsokirka/portfolio_DS/blob/master/images/bike.jpg)?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**76%** accuracy](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Bike_Rental_Demand.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Customer Personality Analysis](https://github.com/alesandrsokirka/Customer_Personality_Analysis_Kaggle/blob/main/Customer_personality.ipynb)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**80%** using **23** epochs](https://github.com/alesandrsokirka/Customer_Personality_Analysis_Kaggle/blob/main/Customer_personality.ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
