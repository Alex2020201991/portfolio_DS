# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

**Click to see project** [Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/alesandrsokirka/linear_regr_seoul_bikes/blob/main/final_linear_regr_seoul_bikes.ipynb) }

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**76%** accuracy](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Bike_Rental_Demand.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

**Click to see project** [Customer Personality Analysis](https://github.com/alesandrsokirka/Customer_Personality_Analysis_Kaggle/blob/main/Customer_personality.ipynb)

<img src="images/customer.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Matplotlib, PCA, Elbow Method

**Project Objective:** Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

**Quantifiable result:** We could use clustering, which helps in understanding the natural grouping in a dataset.

- Initiating PCA to reduce dimentions aka features
- Elbow Method to determine the number of clusters to be formed
- Initiating the Agglomerative Clustering model
